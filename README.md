# Fast Data Processing with Spark 2 - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Fast Data Processing with Spark 2 - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/fast-data-processing-spark-2-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785889271), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<dependency>
<groupId>junit</groupId>
<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
<version>4.11</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Like any development platform, learning to develop systems with Spark takes trial and
error. Writing programs, encountering errors, and agonizing over pesky bugs are all part of
the process. We assume a basic level of programming â€“ Python or Java and experience in
working with operating system commands. We have kept the examples simple and to the
point. In terms of resources, we do not assume any esoteric equipment for running the
examples and developing code. A normal development machine is enough.
